- One annoyance after today's work is that I still haven't found a
  way to properly make the table fit at startup. As soon as you move
  a slider or change the size or position of anything it all fits in
  perfectly, but I can't seem to programmatically make it that way
  at the start.

- INVALID? Discovered that the dates are incorrect... need to
  revise the date calculation mechanism...
  UPDATE: Can't reproduce this bug, everything seems fine.
- Double-clicking a file in the right pane to enter a new directory
  takes more time than clicking it in the left pane. Why?

- When creating a file in the extract process, HFSExplorer does not
  check if the created file is in the right directory. If a file
  contains characters like '/' or '\', the OS might interpret it as
  a directory containing a file, and that directory will then be
  created. Basically File.getName() and File.getParent() will show
  if this condition is met.
  Example: a file in an HFS+ FS is called "AdobeCS3\Clean.log".
  When it is extracted to a Windows system, a directory called
  "AdobeCS3" will be created with a file in it called "Clean.log".
