- One annoyance after today's work is that I still haven't found a
  way to properly make the table fit at startup. As soon as you move
  a slider or change the size or position of anything it all fits in
  perfectly, but I can't seem to programmatically make it that way
  at the start.

- INVALID? Discovered that the dates are incorrect... need to
  revise the date calculation mechanism...
  UPDATE: Can't reproduce this bug, everything seems fine.
- Double-clicking a file in the right pane to enter a new directory
  takes more time than clicking it in the left pane. Why?

- When opening files with java.awt.Desktop.open, and the file
  doesn't have a valid file association, an ugly exception is thrown
  to the user. This should be made more pretty.
