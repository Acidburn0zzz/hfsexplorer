HFSExplorer Changelog
---------------------

0.18.1
------
- Implemented support for wrapped HFS+ volumes. (HFS+ volumes wrapped inside HFS volumes, as in
  http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#HFSWrapper)
- Fixed a minor bug where the user wasn't notified when a file could not be opened.

0.18
----
- Huge rework of the libraries from DMGExtractor, due to a lot of wasted memory leading to
  OutOfMemoryError for huge DMG files. Particulary the XML parser has been seriously
  reconstructed. Tested with an 11 GiB compressed/25 GiB uncompressed UDIF disk image.
- Fixed a serious bug leading to a lot of files not beeing seen by HFSExplorer (though I didn't
  notice it myself). Had to do with the algorithm that collected all files in a directory.
  (thanks to Mark Wainwright for the valuable test case)
- Implemented a Unicode composition algorithm, for those who have been experiencing strange
  filenames whenever there are accents and umlauts in them. (thanks to Wolf Mc Even for info)
- Improved repsonsiveness and usefulness for the progress dialog displayed when extracting
  files from the file system.
- Improved efficiency when reading UDIF disk images (.dmg files). (In some cases probably up to
  a million times faster... ;> ) 
- Implemented double-clicking in the right pane to browse a directory, or to extract (or open),
  a file.
- Implemented right-clicking in the left and right pane for bringing up a popup menu. Currently
  the only option is "Information", which brings up the info window.
- Made the partition choosing dialog default to the first HFS partition found.
- Fixed a bug when running the application in OS X, related to JFileChooser (all in all,
  JFileChooser seems very buggy in OS X).
- Fixed a non critical bug with HFSPlusBSDInfo. Apparently some root nodes (CNID 2) have a
  special value for "file mode", 0x0, not mentioned in POSIX and such specs (not that I have
  read them, but I assume...) so file info for the root node could not be displayed..
- UI is no longer active while the program loads a file at startup (could be confusing when
  loading large files, where the user might have thought that no operation was in progress)
- Added a debug console window where all the output from System.out and System.err goes when
  the application is running in pure windowed mode.
- Added icons for .dmg files in Windows Explorer. (for source material, thanks to the original
  creator of the icon for GParted, whoever that is...)

0.17
----
- DMG UDIF file support! Most DMG files can now be read directly from within HFSExplorer (no
  prior extraction needed), thanks to integrating code from DMGExtractor. It is all rather slow
  at the moment (especially with compressed images), but expect performance enhancements in the
  future when I implement smarter buffering/caching.
  What is known not to work are .dmg files with ADC or BZIP2 compression and encrypted images.
  Additionally, any image that does not contain an HFS+ file system will obviously not work.
- Created a launcher application for Windows, which automatically locates the Java Runtime
  Environment and starts the application from an .exe file. This launcher might work poorly
  with JREs from other vendors than Sun, so feedback is appreciated from those using non-Sun
  Java Runtime Environments.
- Made a NSIS installer package for Windows users, making it easy to install/uninstall the
  application. The installer is able to create file associations with .dmg files.
- Enabled the address field and "Go" button in HFSExplorer (after many releases where it has
  been disabled, waiting for implementation).
- Title bar now shows which file is open.

0.16
----
- Added automatic detection of partition systems and file systems, so that the user no longer
  needs to worry about whether it should choose to load them with or without APM.
- Added support for the MBR and GUID Partition Table partitioning schemes, making access to
  raw disk images or devices from Intel systems possible. (Not very tested, might be buggy...)
- Added an "autodetect" button to the "Load file system from device" dialog (only for Windows
  users), so that the user doesn't have to look for the correct device itself.
- Added a progress dialog when extracting files, so that users get some info on what's going on.
- Added keyboard shortcuts to menu items.
- Added a menu item to check for newer versions of HFSExplorer.
- Behavior change: When the program encounters an exception while extracting files (for example
  when the disk is full), the user can now choose to abort the entire extraction, or continue.
- Fixed a bug leading to exceptions when failing to load a file system, requiring a restart
  of the program.

0.15.1
------
- Minor Windows Vista fix. The icons were not found when starting HFSExplorer with the
  runfsb_vista.vbs script. Now the icons are included in the JAR file, so they should always
  be available.

0.15
----
- Major UI overhaul with a few icons, changed appearance of the file list. Many things left
  to do though.
- Added information dialogs for presenting information about the volume header, the catalog
  file, detailed file and folder info, some minor info on the journal... (all in preparation
  for future development work on write support)
- Behavior change: Extract button now extracts the entry that was last in focus. If you
  selected a folder in the left pane most recently, that folder will be extracted and not the
  selection in the right pane (and vice versa).
- Fixed a bug submitted by Gennadiy Bukhmatov related to the behavior of
  org.catacombae.hfsexplorer.types.OSType.
- Added a start script for Windows Vista, automatically bringing up the UAC dialog. It has not
  been tested more than that, so please mail me about your experiences with Windows Vista.
  Vista users may run "runfsb_vista.vbs"...

0.11
----
- Fixed a very significant bug, sometimes leading to some files not being seen by HFSExplorer,
  and sometimes leading to a complete crash.
- Made extraction of multiple files, as well as directory trees possible.
- Fixed some uncaught exception when trying to read an Apple Partition Map when it isn't there.
- First release of source code.
