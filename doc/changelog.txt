0.15.1
------
- Minor Windows Vista fix. The icons were not found when starting HFSExplorer with the
  runfsb_vista.vbs script. Now the icons are included in the JAR file, so they should always
  be available.

- Major UI overhaul with a few icons, changed appearance of the file list. Many things left
  to do though.
- Added information dialogs for presenting information about the volume header, the catalog
  file, detailed file and folder info, some minor info on the journal... (all in preparation
  for future development work on write support)
- Behavior change: Extract button now extracts the entry that was last in focus. If you
  selected a folder in the left pane most recently, that folder will be extracted and not the
  selection in the right pane (and vice versa).
- Fixed a bug submitted by Gennadiy Bukhmatov related to the behavior of
  org.catacombae.hfsexplorer.types.OSType.
- Added a start script for Windows Vista, automatically bringing up the UAC dialog. It has not
  been tested more than that, so please mail me about your experiences with Windows Vista.
  Vista users may run "runfsb_vista.vbs"...
