HFSExplorer TODO:

- All in bugs.txt
- Valence of a folder should be read immediatly after expansion so that the user
  doesn't have to click it to see if it contains any children.
- Figure out how to catch mouse clicks in a JTableHeader, so I can sort like
  Windows Explorer does.
- Figure out how to remove the grey background in the table...
- Make autodetect in windows dialog capable of autodetecting partitioning systems.
  Otherwise iPod-users and users of Mac-formatted hard drives will suffer.
- Pass a flag on to HFSExplorer telling it to redirect stdout and stderr to an
  internal console window, in case we start HFSExplorer without a text console.
- Create an indeterminate progress monitor window for when opening DMG files
  (reading their structures) takes a long time.
- Add an option to rename a file if its filename can't be created in the current
  operating system. Also add a "skip all" option to supress further such messages,
  and an "auto-rename" option, if an algorithm can be found for that.
