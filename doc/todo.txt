HFSExplorer TODO:

- All in bugs.txt [LÅT STÅ]

- Valence of a folder should be read immediatly after expansion so that the user
  doesn't have to click it to see if it contains any children.

- Figure out how to catch mouse clicks in a JTableHeader, so I can sort like
  Windows Explorer does.

- Create an indeterminate progress monitor window for when opening DMG files
  (reading their structures) takes a long time.

- Implement support for symbolic links. Need to read more about them.

    I really like this tool and its a good alternative to other more expensive 
    solutions, however, one thing I've notived is that it is unable to read files 
    from the Time Machine directory.  I tried to access a couple of files from my 
    Time Machine backup drive while my Mac in is for repair, however HFS explorer 
    doesn't seem to be able to resolve the links that are part of the Time Machine 
    backup structure.
    
    Anyway, thanks for your work and I hope you continue improving your program.

- Backing store structure view:
  View the different data layers through which the HFS+ file system was loaded.

- Detection of ISO9660/UDF file systems, to help the user understand why the
  optical media image could not be loaded.

- HFS+ volume label change. (First write-feature...)

- UDIF menu for UDIF-loaded file systems where the user can convert UDIF to ISO
  and also display properties on the UDIF file, for instance type
  (UDBZ, UDCO, etc.).

- Improvements on the extract dialog:
  - "Advanced >>" button which displays checkboxes for default actions when
    encountering Overwrite situations, Rename situations, Directory already
    exists operations... etc.
  - Show a log file at the end (which can be saved) displaying all errors
    encountered and which actions were taken in response.

- Tools menu -> Calculate file system fragmentation
  To find out how badly fragmented files are in the file system. Code is already
  there for hfsx command line tool.

- Info dialog summary for files and folders with recursive background calculation
  of tree weights (like Explorer). Should be the first tab for files and folders.

- Implement file thread and folder thread views in the B-Tree view.

- Complete journal view, in preparation of write mode. We must be able to utilize
  journaling from the beginning, because we can't trust the operating system's
  write caching features.
