HFSExplorer TODO:

- All in bugs.txt
- Valence of a folder should be read immediatly after expansion so that the user
  doesn't have to click it to see if it contains any children.
- I need to figure out how to add actions to double-clicks and right-clicks in the
  table and in the tree.
- Figure out how to catch mouse clicks in a JTableHeader, so I can sort like
  Windows Explorer does.
- Implement a composition algorithm, that converts the decomposed name strings into
  standard Unicode ones.
- Figure out how to remove the grey background in the table...
- Make autodetect in windows dialog capable of autodetecting partitioning systems.
  Otherwise iPod-users and users of Mac-formatted hard drives will suffer.
- Pass a flag on to HFSExplorer telling it to redirect stdout and stderr to an
  internal console window, in case we start HFSExplorer without a text console.
- Create an indeterminate progress monitor window for when opening DMG files
  (reading their structures) takes a long time.
