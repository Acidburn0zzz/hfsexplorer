HFSExplorer TODO:

- All in bugs.txt
- Valence of a folder should be read immediatly after expansion so that the user
  doesn't have to click it to see if it contains any children.
- Figure out how to catch mouse clicks in a JTableHeader, so I can sort like
  Windows Explorer does.
- Create an indeterminate progress monitor window for when opening DMG files
  (reading their structures) takes a long time.
