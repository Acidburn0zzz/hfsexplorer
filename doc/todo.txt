HFSExplorer TODO:

- All in bugs.txt

- Valence of a folder should be read immediatly after expansion so that the user
  doesn't have to click it to see if it contains any children.

- Figure out how to catch mouse clicks in a JTableHeader, so I can sort like
  Windows Explorer does.

- Create an indeterminate progress monitor window for when opening DMG files
  (reading their structures) takes a long time.

- Sorting of files in the right pane by clicking the table headers.

- Implement support for symbolic links. Need to read more about them.

    I really like this tool and its a good alternative to other more expensive 
    solutions, however, one thing I've notived is that it is unable to read files 
    from the Time Machine directory.  I tried to access a couple of files from my 
    Time Machine backup drive while my Mac in is for repair, however HFS explorer 
    doesn't seem to be able to resolve the links that are part of the Time Machine 
    backup structure.
    
    Anyway, thanks for your work and I hope you continue improving your program.
